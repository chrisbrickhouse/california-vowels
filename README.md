# California Vowels
This repository contains files related to my second qualifying paper on the low back vowels in California English using data
from the Voices of California project. It includes scripts for analyzing data in the R programming language, the Praat 
scripts I am using, and some preliminary visualizations of the aggregate data.

# Acknowledgements
Most of the scripts in the ```praat_scripts``` folder weren't written by me but were modified to some extent to fit my 
purposes and make my life easier. Thanks to James Kirby whose [PraatSauce](https://github.com/kirbyj/praatsauce) suite is 
included here, modifications to which are distributed under the terms listed in that directory. Those praat scripts with the 
suffix "sk" were written by Seung Kyung while at Stanford, and I owe her thanks for both the functionality and well 
documented code. Not included in this repository but still of importance to this repository actually working are the 
program [Praat](https://github.com/praat/praat), the [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/), 
[RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio), [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse), and the 
[FAVE Force Aligner](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE).
